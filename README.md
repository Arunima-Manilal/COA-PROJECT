## 📸 Ripes Simulator Observations

### 🔹 Cache Statistics – Normal Matrix Multiplication
- High number of **compulsory and capacity cache misses**
- Repeated memory accesses cause frequent cache evictions
- Lower cache hit rate due to poor locality


---

### 🔹 Cache Statistics – Blocked Matrix Multiplication
- Significantly **reduced cache misses**
- Higher cache hit rate due to **blocking (tiling)**
- Improved performance from **temporal and spatial locality**

### 📊 Comparison Summary
| Method | Cache Hits | Cache Misses |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| Normal Multiplication | Low | High |
| Blocked Multiplication | High | Low |
